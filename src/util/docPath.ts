/**
 * H-1 — symlink-safe resolution of **document** paths (spec/adr/plan).
 *
 * A repository huginn reads is attacker-controlled the moment it is not ours: a
 * clone can ship `spec.md -> ~/.aws/credentials`, `adr.md -> /etc/passwd` or a
 * `docs/` directory that points anywhere on the host. Both directions were open:
 *
 * - **read** — `readOptional`/`readFileBounded` followed the link, so the target's
 *   content was read and embedded in an agent prompt (an exfiltration channel
 *   straight out of the project), and
 * - **write** — `writeDoc` followed it too, so the drafting step *overwrote* the
 *   link target (a `~/.aws/credentials` clobbered by a generated `spec.md`).
 *
 * The rule enforced here is deliberately simple and fail-closed:
 *
 * 1. The final path component is `lstat`ed and a **symlink is always refused** —
 *    the link is never followed, read or overwritten. This holds for every caller,
 *    including the ones whose doc genuinely lives outside the project, because
 *    "an explicitly configured path" is a reason to allow the *file*, never a
 *    reason to let a repo swap it for a link to somewhere else.
 * 2. When the path is lexically **inside the project root** — the normal case, and
 *    the only one an attacker controls — the resolved path must stay inside the
 *    resolved project root as well: `realpath` resolves every component, so a
 *    symlinked *parent* (`docs/ -> /etc`) is caught too, and the containment test
 *    runs on the real paths so a project reached through a symlink (macOS
 *    `/var` → `/private/var`) is not mistaken for an escape.
 *
 * Legitimate out-of-project docs (`--spec /srv/shared/spec.md`) keep working: they
 * are only symlink-screened, exactly as the pre-existing behaviour but without the
 * link-following hole.
 *
 * A path that does not exist yet is accepted (plan mode drafts new documents):
 * the nearest existing ancestor is resolved and the missing tail is re-joined, so
 * containment is still decided on real paths.
 *
 * The same screen — it is a path rule, not a document rule — also guards the
 * **operational** paths a cloned repository can ship as links just as easily as a
 * document: the harness state, phase reports and progress page (SEC-102), the
 * iteration receipts (SEC-102), the server log (SEC-101) and the update cache
 * (SEC-105). Only the mechanism is reused: a symlink on the final component is
 * always refused, and a project-relative path must resolve inside the project.
